## Discover your true vibe 

### By Kylei Hoffland, Gianna Lammer, Nathan Breunig, Jon Noel 

#### For our project, we will use the Spotify API as a music analysis tool to generate playlists and determine your most popular jams. Using a GUI, the user can generate playlists based on genre, artist, songs, etc. These playlists will contain songs never listened to by the user. In addition to this, the user will also be able to generate word clouds based on lyrics, top artists, songs, and more.  

#### Features: 

<ul>
  <li>Suggest songs based on an identified theme </li>
  <li>Create word clouds in real time</li>
  <li>Generate word cloud based on users most listened to artitsts and songs, as well as the lyrics to any song</li>
  <li>Suggest songs with opposite themes</li>
</ul>

<p>We chose this project because the current system of music is broken. We are stuck in a jukebox of captivity. Every online radio recommends the same songs, including Spotify. We want to create a convenient way of discovering new music without pushing the user too far from their comfort zone.  </p>

#### Technologies Needed: 

<ul>
  <li>Spotify API</li>
  <li>Genius API</li>
  <li>World Cloud Generator API</li>
  <li>Python GUI Library (Kivy?)</li>
  <li>Dictionary.com API</li>
</ul>
